# Introduction
I worked on this project a few years ago.

We had many Microsoft Excel sheets containing information about product versions. Each of these documents had many versions and each product line also had a document of its own.

# Use cases
Users of this data wanted a centralised location from which they could search, view and visualize the data. If a new version of the document is released, or if an existing document is updated, the destination dataset should reflect those as well.

## Considerations
1. The data should be available for analysis - using interactive querying and/or visualization methods.
2. The data should refresh automatically via batch jobs when there is new data. Additionally, this introduces the additional use case of detecting new data. 
3. The data should be secure and should be available to only a list of allowed individuals.

## Extraction
Instead of focusing on the extraction first, I started to think of different ways in which we could store the data and then build a pipeline to read from the data sources.
