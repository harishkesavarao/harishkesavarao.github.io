# Introduction
I worked on this project a few years ago.

We had many Microsoft Excel sheets containing information about product versions. Each of these documents had many versions and each product line also had a document of its own.

## Transformation

## Storage and Business Intelligence



# Design choices
## Off-the-shelf products.
## Connectivity via MS SQL Server.
## Custom solution

# Implementation
