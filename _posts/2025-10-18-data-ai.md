# Intro
Data needs to deliver context, reliability and speed for AI models to be successful and to deliver value to end users.

Data teams: data scientists and data engineers typically work together to achieve this. While the AI and model parts of the equation are quite well-known, there are pieces behind the curtains, specifically, data pipelines and the surrounding infrastructure.

# Behind the scenes of AI

Data pipelines and infrastructure need to work well for AI to succeed.

What makes AI “useful”?

AI usefulness = accurate, explainable, timely, and context-aware outcomes.

The data’s job is to:

- Represent reality accurately (data completeness, freshness, contextual richness).
- Enable learning (well-labeled, unbiased, high-quality training data).
- Support adaptability (feedback loops, retraining, continuous data ingestion).

Examples:

- Recommendation engines (Netflix) → depend on granular, real-time event data.
- Fraud detection → only as strong as the labeled transaction data.
- LLMs (ChatGPT, Copilot) → rely on clean, diverse, multi-domain datasets.

Bottomline, the user never “sees” the data, but every AI experience feels it.

## The data -> AI lifecycle


## Data Quality and Governance

Quality dimensions (accuracy, completeness, bias), lineage, governance, and reproducibility.

## Data Engineering as the Enabler

Modern data stack (Databricks, Spark, Airflow, Kafka, Feature Stores).

## Data for ML: Labeling and Feature Engineering

Importance of labeled data, domain knowledge, and reusable feature stores. AutoML and data-centric optimization.

# Monitoring, Drift & Continuous Learning

Model drift, data drift, MLOps feedback loops — data as the heartbeat of ongoing improvement.

# Data-centric AI

Shifting from “model tuning” to “data refinement.”
