## What is a Data Lake?
[Reading for this section: What is a Data Lake](#pre-requisite-reading)
> A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analyticsâ€”from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

# Use cases
It is cost effective and performant to build a Data Lake when the data volume is over a certain threshold. The threshold is usually in the tens of GBs of data per day and continues to accumulate over time. If the data volume is less than that, it would be quicker and cheaper to build a traditional data warehouse or other solutions.

As we saw above, a Data Lake is a centralized repository which stores all of the structured and unstructured data. This means that this data is available to anyone in an organization (with the relevant permissions). This could be - Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Business Analysts, Product Managers, Finance or any other function. This offers a single source of truth of the data and each sub-function or department within an organization can choose to use the data as they see fit, with their own tooling for data access, analytics and visualization.


# Architecture
First, we will try to see the different pieces of a typical big data flow. Then, we can explore the different options available in AWS to accommodate those pieces. This will help us arrive at our actual architecture diagram which will more closely represent our actual implementation.

`TODO: Data Flow Diagram`


# Data sources
Typically, data sources come from within AWS itself. In rare exceptions, the data comes from outside the cloud, or from another cloud provider. We will discuss both scenarios.

## AWS S3
[AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) is one of the most common use cases of consuming data in AWS. You can read about the basics (buckets, etc.) of S3 from the documentation link.
### Cross-account storage
[Reading for this section: AWS Organizations and AWS Accounts](#pre-requisite-reading)
Sometimes, the S3 bucket containing the data of interest may not reside in the same AWS account from which we are reading it. To begin reading from such external accounts, the required permissions need to be in place.
