Hello, I am a Staff Software Engineer for Security Data Infrastructure at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/).

I am currently involved in designing, automating and scaling multi-TB/day in AWS and Azure using Spark.

My interests and key areas of work include: 
* Designing and building big data infrastructure on the cloud or on-premise.
* Performance tuning for high-volume data ingestion.
* Automation of workflows, automated infrastructure management on the cloud.
* Data Engineering in general.

Periodically, I also contribute to Apache Airflow providers and do code reviews.
