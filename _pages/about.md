Hello, I am Harish, a Data Engineering & Cloud Data Infrastructure professional. 

I hold a Masters Degree from the [University of Arizona's Eller College of Management](https://eller.arizona.edu/programs/masters/mis/mis), majoring in Management Information Systems. It is the #2 ranked best public graduate information systems program per U.S. News & World Report 2025.

**_Although I am located in India for the past year, almost all of my professional work experience (2012-2024) and my advanced education has been from the United States._**

Currently, I am a Principal Data Engineer & Data Architect for the Data Engineering organization at [Altassian India]((https://www.atlassian.com/blog/atlassian-engineering)). 

My most recent role, prior to Atlassian's was Staff Software Engineer and Data Engineering Team Lead for [Security](https://www.databricks.com/trust) at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), where I was involved in overseeing the execution of multi-quarter Data Engineering projects, including design, automation and scaling of multi-TB/day data in [AWS](https://www.databricks.com/product/aws) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/databricks).

Earlier, I was in Senior Data Engineering(Individual Contributor) roles at [Salesforce's Tableau](https://engineering.tableau.com/), [Amazon's Prime Video](https://www.primevideotech.com/) and Indeed.com. In Amazon, I was hired as the first Data Engineer to help build a Data Lake for Prime Video Search. At [Indeed](https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/category/big-data/), I worked for Marketing, Sales and Finance to help build their datawarehouses. 

Prior to Indeed, I was in various roles are [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com/), focusing mainly on building ETL pipelines between relational databases and [MPP databases](https://www.sisense.com/glossary/mpp-database/).

My interests and key areas of work include: 
* Understanding short-term & long-term data engineering requirements, converting them into high-level data architecture roadmaps for execution.
* Designing, building and scaling big data pipelines to ingest large volume data via **Spark** and **AWS, Azure**. I also have experience deploying big data pipelines on-premise.
* Performance tuning for high volume ingestion pipelines with **SparkStreaming / AWS Kinesis, Azure Eventhubs on Databricks**.
* Automation of workflows (such as Apache Airflow and other equivalent tooling on the cloud), automated infrastructure management on the cloud using **Terraform (HCL)**.
* Experience in configuring and deploying **Docker** containers for specialized use cases.
* Extensive experience in writing Data Engineering code (primarily Python and Scala), adhering to good software engineering practices.
* I also contribute to Open Source projects on a regular basis. I developed the first DAG Sensors for the Databricks Provider in **Apache Airflow**.
